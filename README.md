# ChallengeChain

**The Daily Challenge App** is a mobile application designed to help users create and participate in daily challenges with their friends. The app aims to promote motivation, accountability, and a sense of accomplishment by encouraging users to complete daily tasks and maintain a consistent streak of completing challenges without breaking the chain.

**Key Features:**

**Challenge Creation:** Users can create new challenges by specifying the challenge name, alarm time for daily reminders, challenge duration (in days), and inviting their friends to participate.

**Challenge Invitations:** Participants receive invitations to join challenges from their friends. They can accept or decline the invitations, indicating their willingness to participate.

**Challenge Start:** Once all invited participants accept the challenge invitation, the challenge owner can start the challenge. At this point, the challenge becomes active and participants can begin tracking their progress.

**Daily Completion:** Participants are required to mark their challenge completion status daily. They can mark a challenge as completed or incomplete for each day of the challenge duration.

**Chain Streak:** The app tracks the participants' daily completion status, encouraging them to maintain a continuous streak of completed challenges without any breaks. Users can view their current streak and aim to increase it.

**Rewards:** Participants who successfully complete the challenge without breaking the chain are rewarded with points. The app tracks and assigns rewards based on their achievements, providing a sense of accomplishment and motivation.

**Challenge Messaging:** Participants can communicate with each other within the app through messages or warnings related to the challenge status. They can provide support, reminders, or encouragement to help each other stay motivated and complete the challenges successfully.

**User Profile:** Users have their profiles where they can view their challenges, achievements, points, and overall progress. They can also manage their challenge invitations and view the challenges they are participating in.
